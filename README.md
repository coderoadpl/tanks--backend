# coderaod--tanks backend

This is a simple multiplayer game server with ephemeral in memory storage.

## Possible improvements

1. Adding tests – not implemented due to complexity involving testing geometry
2. Implementing persistent storage – not implemented due to necessarily of spinning up database and slower IO operations on data
3. Possibility to add more players (backend only).
4. Possibility to add obstacles on the map (backend + frontend).
5. Possibility to have more health points and make more damage points (backend only).
6. Possibility of playing replays of ended games from memory (backend + frontend)
